In this project I develop a visual way of understanding the performance of a class in examns. It contains static and interactive plots from different aspects of the examns. 

#### Files contain in this repository: 

  - exam_1.xlsx: Excel file with the scores of the examn 1, it contains 4 columns: id, conceptual, numerical, total. conceptual is the score in the conceptual part of the examn, numerical is the score in the numerical part of the examn, total is the sum of conceptual and numerical
  - exam1_analysis.ipynb: Python notebook with the visual analysis of scores written as a report that is thought to be exporter without code.
  - Convertion guide.txc: Guide for exporting the python notebook as a HTML file hidding the code in it.
  - exam1_analysis.html: Result of the analysis in html format ready to deliver to the professor or students. 
  - .gitignore: conventional un-tracked documents for git system.
  
  
#### Future devolopements: 
I will develop a **comparative** analysis of two examns so we can se the evolution of the students in the course.
