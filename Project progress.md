# Version 1 (currently): 
In version 1 of this project I develop a visual analysis of an examn (in particular examn_1.xlsx) wich is developed in exam1_analysis.ipynb

# Version 2:
In version 2 of this project I am interested in developing a visual analysis of examn 2 but also compare it to the scores in examn 1. So the exam2_analysis.ipynb contains this ideas. 

# Version 3: 
In version 3 of this project I take advantages of the 3 examns the class have faced to further evolve the analysis to a 3D setting. exam3_analysis.ipynb

# Version 4: 
In version 4, I am interested in the automatization of the report so '.py' libraries are constructed to create functions that allows to graph in a simple framework.

# Version 5: 
In this version I am cetered in the scalability of this project at my university, simplifying more the framework so that it becomes an integral part of the teaching experience.
